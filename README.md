# 🚀 DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my DevOps learning journey!  
This repository is my **personal knowledge base** where I document everything I learn while transitioning into DevOps – from the **basics of Linux** to advanced concepts like **CI/CD, Containers, and Cloud**.

I believe in **learning in public**, so this repo is both my study space and a resource for anyone starting DevOps.

---

## 📂 Topics Covered

- 🐧 **Linux Basics** → Commands, scripting, server management
- 🌱 **Git & GitHub** → Version control, branching, collaboration
- 🔧 **Jenkins** → CI/CD pipelines, automation
- 📦 **Docker** → Containers, images, docker-compose
- ☸️ **Kubernetes** → Pods, deployments, scaling, configs
- ⚙️ **Ansible** → Configuration management, playbooks
- ☁️ **Cloud (AWS)** → EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, CloudWatch, VPC
- 🏗️ **Terraform** → Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
